# Embedded System based Microwave-oven-project in picsimlab

The project is designed to develop empowering microwave oven simulation in PICSimLab. PICSimLab is a real time emulator of 
development boards with integrated MPLABX/XC8 IDE compiler and MPLAB X IDE code purpose used . PICSimLab have 
integration with MPLABX for programming the boards microcontrollers. As the 
purpose of PICSimLab is to emulate real hardware it does not have any source code editing 
support. 
A microwave oven isÂ a relatively small, boxlike oven that raises the temperature of food by subjecting it to a high-frequency electromagnetic field. 
The microwaves are absorbed by water, fats, sugars, and certain other molecules, whose consequent vibrations produce heat.
We are going to implement 4 modes.
  ! Micro Mode  :- This mode is used to cook in a traditional way. It uses a maximum power of 900w in this maximum time that you set for cooking 60 minutes. 

  ! Grill Mode  :- This mode is used to cook meat and bread. It works as the micro mode but the purpose is to cook meat and bread. User can set times as per the cooking time of the meat.

 ! Convection Mode :- In this mode user can set the oven to pre heat for  a particular temperature and it takes3 minutes to preheat the oven. After pre heating ids done then the user can set the time as per the requirements.

Start Mode :- this mode is used to any mode berake afre this mode is again restart.
