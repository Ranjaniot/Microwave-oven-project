# Embedded System based Microwave-oven-project in picsimlab

The project is designed to develop empowering microwave oven simulation in PICSimLab. PICSimLab is a real time emulator of 
development boards with integrated MPLABX/XC8 IDE compiler and MPLAB X IDE code purpose used . PICSimLab have 
integration with MPLABX for programming the boards microcontrollers. As the 
purpose of PICSimLab is to emulate real hardware it does not have any source code editing 
support. 
A microwave oven isÂ a relatively small, boxlike oven that raises the temperature of food by subjecting it to a high-frequency electromagnetic field. 
The microwaves are absorbed by water, fats, sugars, and certain other molecules, whose consequent vibrations produce heat.
We are going to implement 4 modes.
Micro Mode
Grill Mode
Convection Mode
Start Mode
